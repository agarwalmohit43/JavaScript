Prototypal Inheritance:

[[Prototype]]: It is special hidden property in Objects.
__proto__: it is getter/setter for the [[Prototype]] property.

In modern JS
__proto__ is replaced by Object.getPrototypeOf/Object.setPrototypeOf


F.prototype
In function constructor new objects can be created by new F().

F.prototype is an object then new keyword set the [[Prototype]] of it.
The default "prototype" is an object with the only property constructor that points back to the function itself.
ex: 
function Rabbit() {}
// by default:
// Rabbit.prototype = { constructor: Rabbit }

alert( Rabbit.prototype.constructor == Rabbit ); // true
