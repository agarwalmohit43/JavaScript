Closure:
A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them.
Every func in js is closures.
[[Environment]] property and lexical environments work is great example for it.

Need to revise:
Array function
fun.call, func.apply
func.bind
prototypes


use of loadash libraries
Polyfills


substring vs slice
